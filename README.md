# Pokémon-Themed Archive Portfolio

A playful, Pokémon-inspired portfolio site built as an archive/alt portfolio to complement my main one at [anuj-kulkarni-portfolio.vercel.app](https://anuj-kulkarni-portfolio.vercel.app/). Design inspiration credits to Pocholo Nicolas Q. De Leon, with custom tweaks and content by Anuj C. Kulkarni (myself).

## Highlights
- Characterful Pokémon look and feel with animated section reveals and custom pixel font
- Sections for Home, About, FAQ, Experience, and Contact with smooth in-page navigation
- Mobile-friendly navigation with hamburger menu toggle
- Social links, badges, and outreach info front and center for quick contact

## Tech Stack
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Local assets: custom font and Pokémon-themed imagery (educational/fair-use intent)
